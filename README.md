# Machine-learning-algorithms-to-detect-ransomware-attack

This aimed to examine a machine-learning approach for categorizing ransomware using random forests and characteristics collected from the raw bytes of the file. To build the most effective XGBoost classifier that can reliably identify ransomware, several different sizes of seeds and trees have been put through experimental testing. It is a static analysis for byte-level properties to identify ransomware. In addition, we have compared each algorithm to other machine learning approaches such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and Radom Forest, XGBoost was evaluated using performance measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. All four algorithms have given their own best performance to detect bad files, however Logistic regression and XGBoost were given the best results in comparison with other algorithms.
